Create a .env file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

```
PORT=8080
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```
Then run the application using the command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

A postman collection is included in the root directory to help you test the API endpoints.
You can import the `url-shorter.postman_collection.json` file into Postman to get started with testing the API.
